    "### Terminology\n",
    "##### Vertex  \n",
    "A vertex is the most basic part of a graph and it is also called a node. Throughout we'll call it note. A vertex may also have additional information and we'll call it as payload.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Edge    \n",
    "An edge is another basic part of a graph, and it connects two vertices/ Edges may be one-way or two-way. If the edges in a graph are all one-way, the graph is a directed graph, or a digraph. The picture shown above is not a digraph.\\n\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Weight   \n",
    "Edges may be weighted to show that there is a cost to go from one vertex to another. For example in a graph of roads that connect one city to another, the weight on the edge might represent the distance between the two cities or traffic status.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Graph   \n",
    "A graph can be represented by G where G=(V,E). V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges. Each edge is a tuple (v,w) where w,v in V. We can add a third component to the edge tuple to represent a weight. A subgraph s is a set of edges e and vertices v such that e in E and v in V.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    V={a,b,c,d,e,f}\n",
    "    and the set of nine edges:\n",
    " \n",
    "    E={(a,b,7),(a,c,9),(a,f,14),(b,d,15),(b,c,10),(c,d,11),(c,f,2),(d,e,6),(e,f,9)}\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### Path    \n",
    "A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. We usually define a path as w_1, w_2,..., w_n such that (w_i, w_{i+1}) in E for all 1 le i le n-1. The unweighted path length is the number of edges in the path (n-1). The weighted path length is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path. For example in the picture above, the path from a to e is the sequence of vertices (a, c, d, e). The edges are {(a, c, 9), (c, d, 11), (d, e, 6)}.\n",
    " \n",
    "##### Cycle   \n",
    "A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph with no cycles is called an acyclic graph. A directed graph with no cycles is called a directed acyclic graph or a DAG."

    "Vertex class uses a dictionary (adjacent) to keep track of the vertices to which it is connected, and the weight of each edge. The Vertex constructor initializes the id, which is usually a string, and the adjacent dictionary. \n",
